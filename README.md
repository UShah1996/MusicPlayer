# MusicPlayer
My first music application which plays the song Happier sung and written by Ed Sheeran.

The application shows an implementation of forward and rewind options that forwards and rewinds the song by 3 seconds respectively and also the demonstration of play and pause functions. This is the initial level app, which can be used by any beginner to understand the basic functionality of a music application.
